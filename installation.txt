Upload all files to your html documents root in ASCII format.

Example:
/home/pagename/public_html/choices/

By adding
<?php $scripturi='/choices/'; chdir('/home/pagename/public_html/choices/'); include('show.php');?>
to your index page the script will run.
Note that the paths will have to be altered to suit your installation location. See below.

$scripturi='/choices/'; #this will be the path to the script at the end of your sites URL 

chdir('/home/pagename/public_html/choices/'); #this will be the full server path to the scripts

*****IMPORTANT******
To set an admin username and password, edit the vars.php file to suit.
For added protection, secure the /choices/admin folder with an .htaccess file

The admin panel can be accessed at:
http://yoursite.com/choices/admin/
in the above example.
